This project aims at producing a high-quality, physically and perceptually basedsound-field rendering tool adapted to the electro-acoustic and mixed composition.The resulting software is intended to be primarily used in a mixed contemporarycomposition. Following the insights given by N. Peters [? ] in terms of spatial aspectsof compositional practices, the software will be integrated as a plug-in, controlled by an external interface and in pseudoreal- time (depending on the resolution of therendering). The originality of this work is based on the implementation of GAUS researchresults, in terms of acoustic imagery and sound field environment restitutionsinto a composer-dedicated tool. It aims to give to the user some new acoustical representationsto understand, finely predict and compose with spatialization.
